Great! Based on your vision and the guide you provided, here's a structured knowledge base and workflow setup for your AI assistant that will act as the foundation for client interaction:

AI Assistant Knowledge Base (Client-Facing Behavior)

1. User Access

AI Use Preferred: Clients are encouraged to log in and communicate via the AI chat for faster, more organized production handling.

Manual Alternative: Clients who do not wish to use the AI can message staff directly, but AI usage is highly recommended.

AI Role: Even when a human responds, the AI should still generate a detailed project spreadsheet and handle workflow support.


2. Basic Rate System

Starting Rate: Determined based on the complexity of the project (see levels below).

Rate Estimation Process:

The AI will gather initial project scope (layout needs, storyboards, animation, sound, etc.).

It will match the request to a complexity tier (Basic, Moderate, Advanced, Premium).

Based on tier, a starting base rate is offered, and can be bargained depending on deadlines and revisions.



3. Negotiation Logic

Lame Client Mode: Explain clearly with analogies, avoid jargon, provide samples.

Informed Client Mode: Jump straight to rates, specs, and deadlines.

The AI can suggest discounts, timeline extensions, or refer to human when needed.


4. Production Categories and Add-On Pricing

Storyboard (E-konte) – Charged per minute or scene block.

Layout (Reiauto) – Base on scene count.

2nd Key Animation (Daini Genga) – Optional quality enhancement.

Compositing (Konpojitto) – VFX, scene merging.

Voice/Audio (Afureko) – Requires separate quote.

Corrections – Charged if not caused by production fault.


5. Project Agreement Output

Once a production deal is made, the AI will auto-generate a Project Request Spreadsheet including:

Client name and project title

Pipeline stages

Deadlines for each stage

Assigned team (AI/human)

Payment method

Revision agreements

Final delivery date



6. Payment Handling

Payment Method: Prompt client to choose: Bank Transfer, PayPal, Crypto, Local Payment System.

Payment Terms: 50% upfront, 50% upon delivery unless custom terms are arranged.


7. Human Transfer Option

AI offers to escalate to a human if:

The client insists

A request exceeds AI’s current decision scope


Even during human interactions, the AI continues to monitor and assist.

Would you like me to draft a chatbot script or interface flow for how this AI will talk to clients step-by-step? I can also start building the Project Request Spreadsheet template for your pipeline.
